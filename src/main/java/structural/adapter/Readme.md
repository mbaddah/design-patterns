# Adapter pattern

Brief:
- Acts as wrapper between two objects to solve incompatibility issues.

Sample uses:
- Convert legacy system to compatible newer system
- XML to JSON converter
- Mph to Kmph

Key notes:
- Adapter pattern makes use of a constructor which takes abstract/interface type as parameter

# Facade pattern

Brief:
- Provides interface to interact with by hiding complexity from user.
- Manage full life cycle of objects they use.
- Handy if don't require full extent of library and only require small subset.

Sample uses:
- Video converter
- 

Key notes:
- Facade provides a single class to handle complexity.

Pros/Cons:
- Isolate code from subsystem complexity

- Risk of facade becoming a 'god' object
